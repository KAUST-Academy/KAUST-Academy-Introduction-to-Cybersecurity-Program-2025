In the first lab, our task is to prepare the course environment. 
First, the instructor share a folder with the required files with the class.
Then the instructor guide the class through the installation and setup of necessary software. 
Project each step to ensure clarity and understanding among the participants. 
Below are the steps to follow to set up the lab environment.

(To check: Click on the Apple logo → About This Mac).

    https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-installer-images
    - Download the ARM64 version of the Kali Linux ISO for Apple Silicon from

# Install Metasploitable on VMware (Windows & ~Intel based MacBooks) 
    https://www.rapid7.com/products/metasploit/metasploitable/
    - Download and unzip "metasploitable-linux-2.0.0.zip"
    - Double click "Metasploitable.vmx" then select "I Copied It"


# Install Metasploitable on VirtualBox (Windows & ~Intel based MacBooks) 
    https://www.rapid7.com/products/metasploit/metasploitable/
    - Download and unzip "metasploitable-linux-2.0.0.zip"
    - Open VirtualBox
    - Go to machine > new
        - name: "metasploitable"
        - type: Linux
        Go to hardware > Use an existing Virtual Hard Disk file > select the "Metasploitable.vmdk"
        Finish

## Notes: ##
-Problem: Available only for Windows devices and Intel Mac machines (not Apple Silicon).
-Solution: Students using M1/M2 MacBooks converted the VMDK file to QCOW2 by following these steps:

    Install Homebrew.
    Install QEMU using Homebrew.
    Convert the VMDK file to QCOW2 using the command:
    `qemu-img convert -p -O qcow2 Metasploitable.vmdk Metasploitable.qcow2`.
    Run the .qcow2 file in UTM (emulation mode).
    Disable UEFI Boot in the VM settings.

Problem: Some tools and programs do not run on the ARM version of Kali (M1/M2).
Solution: There is no direct fix. The alternatives are:
    
    Using an Intel/AMD laptop.
    Running the machine on a cloud-hosted VM platform (though this may not be practical).

- If the resolution of Kali is very low/stretched, inside Kali go to the logo on the top left corner, select Settings, Settings Manager, Display and change the resolution
- If the copy/paste functionality of virtualbox is not working (even if it's selected in the settings), go to Devices (right ctrl-C if you have to, to see this menu), Shared Folders, Shared Folders Settings, and add a folder you'd like access to inside Kali. This way you can copy/paste from files inside that folder.
